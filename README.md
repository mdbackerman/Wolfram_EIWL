# Wolfram_EIWL

Each notebook corresponds to a chapter from Stephen Wolfram's book "An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language". This book is freely accessed online at [this link](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/?source=nav). The interactive online course w/ videos and exercises is found at [this link](https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/an-elementary-introduction-to-the-wolfram-language/). All exercises and challenge exercises are completed in the respective notebooks. Notebooks titled "0#-blank" are notebooks that did not have exercises or challenge exercises associated with that specific chapter. In order to view a notebook, the desired file should be 1. copied to a text file (Visual Studio Code will work), 2. saved with the `.nb` extension, and 3. opened with Mathematica.
